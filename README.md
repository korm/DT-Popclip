***BETA***

This is a PopClip extension for DEVONthink

Please post any questions in [DT-Popclip Issues](https://github.com/korm/DT-Popclip/issues)

To install.  First, be running OS X on a Mac and have the most recent version of PopClip running.  Download a zip file from this page and double click **DEVONthink.popclipext**

***To Use:***

* Be running DEVONthink
* Use PopClip as usual.  
* When the DEVONthink extension is activated, click the DEVONthink icon from PopClip's menu. 
*  The focus will switch to DEVONthink, and a dialog will open showing the text that will be clipped, along with header information:

	* clipped-on date
	* clipped-from application source
	* if you are clipping from Safari, the URL of the page from which you clipped the text

* A text entry field will appear at the bottom of that dialog box where you may OPTIONALLY enter a notation regarding the text you clipped.[^1]

* After clicking **OK** in the dialog, the DEVONthink group selector dialog will open, allowing you to choose the destination database and group for the clipping.
* Click "**OK**" in the group selector, and the clipper will create a rich text (RTF) document congaing the header, the text, and the notation.[^2]
* The focus will then return to the app from which you made the clipping

[^1]: A future release of **DEVONthink.popclipext** will probably make the dialog and notation optional.

[^2]: A future release may make the **Group Selector** dialog optional.
